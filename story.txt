I went to the story with my mom
my mom said she wanted cheese
they did not have cheese
she cried in my arms
we walked home with an overbearing feeling of dissapointment.

Since they were disappointed they went to eat to ice cream.
There they had the dilemma of choosing between mint-choclate-chip and butter pecan.
Finally, they decided on mint-chocolate-chip and continued going back home, this time with 
a smile on their faces.

"But ice cream is no substitute for cheese mom!!!" I said.
"Is this how you plan on parenting me??? One thing doesn't work, 
give up and do something else??"
The line had worked. My poor emotional mom was ready to do anything for me.
I smirked my evil smirk as I knew what I wanted the most.
I laughed an evil gysteric laughter on the inside while saying "Well you could
make it up to me by buying me Pipple Popple's Dark Chocolate"
She looked at me with disgust 

"Oh I'll buy you some chocolate she said" with a classic "provoked mom" tone. 
"You will see." Her last comment had a slight mischievousness character, and
that worried me. The next few days though (once we had returned home) were as
normal. While I didn't get my Pipple Popple's Dark chocolate, I also didn't get
whatever my mom was referring to.

That all changed when when I got home the next day.


Next day I when I woke up, it was my last day of vacation as I had to go back to my Asylum.
In the morning, I saw mister Pipple Popple standing beside my mom. 
Mr Popple said "Son , look I got a new bike for you ". I was so happy my dad got me the new bike.  
I am not a sound sleeper and I hear my parent's noises all night I should tell you. 
But I see weird dreams!
