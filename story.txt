I went to the story with my mom
my mom said she wanted cheese
they did not have cheese
she cried in my arms
we walked home with an overbearing feeling of dissapointment.
On the way home, they saw a park.
They decided they liked the park.
They ran around and had fun.
They started their journey home after buying ice cream from a nearby place.
