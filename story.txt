I went to the story with my mom
my mom said she wanted cheese
they did not have cheese
she cried in my arms
we walked home with an overbearing feeling of dissapointment.

Since they were disappointed they went to eat to ice cream.
There they had the dilemma of choosing between mint-choclate-chip and butter pecan.
Finally, they decided on mint-chocolate-chip and continued going back home, this time with 
a smile on their faces.

"But ice cream is no substitute for cheese mom!!!" I said.
"Is this how you plan on parenting me??? One thing doesn't work, 
give up and do something else??"
The line had worked. My poor emotional mom was ready to do anything for me.
I smirked my evil smirk as I knew what I wanted the most.
I laughed an evil gysteric laughter on the inside while saying "Well you could
make it up to me by buying me Pipple Popple's Dark Chocolate"
She looked at me with disgust
