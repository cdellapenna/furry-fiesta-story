I went to the story with my mom
my mom said she wanted cheese
they did not have cheese
she cried in my arms
we walked home with an overbearing feeling of dissapointment.

Since they were disappointed they went to eat to ice cream.
There they had the dilemma of choosing between mint-choclate-chip and butter pecan.
Finally, they decided on mint-chocolate-chip and continued going back home, this time with 
a smile on their faces.
